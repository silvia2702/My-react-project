      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>My name is Isabella De Leon. In my coding class in school, I am learning how to make a website, but in order to make my website, I needed a topic. I didn't want to make a website about myself because that is too boring. After thinking about it, I decided that I would make a website about the shows I've watched and rate them. Now, here is some basic information about me. I live in Florida, and I come from a Cuban-Peruvian background. I look really European, but I promise you, I'm not. I have an older sister who is seven years older, and although we have a big age gap, she is my best friend. I play volleyball on my club's national team, and I play middle, and ocassionally right-side, and I suck at passing. I mean, I am a middle and I'm 5'9''', so it makes sense. I also love math (shockingly) and I consider myself to be a good student. And, surprisingly, I love to watch shows. I bet you never would have guessed. Because of this, I made this website to describe and rate all the shows I've watched, and you could also input any of your suggestions. Hope you enjoy!</p>
