      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>   My name is Isabella De Leon. In my coding class in school, I am learning how to make a website, but in order to make my website, I needed a topic.</p> 
      <p>I didn't want to make a website about myself because that is too boring. After thinking about it, I decided that I would make a website about the shows I've watched and rate them.</p>
      <p>   Now, here is some basic information about me. I live in Florida, and I come from a Cuban-Peruvian background. I look really European, but I promise you, I'm not.</p>
      <p>I have an older sister who is seven years older, and although we have a big age gap, she is my best friend. I play volleyball on my club's national team, and I play middle,</p>
      <p>and ocassionally right-side, and I suck at passing. I mean, I am a middle, so it makes sense. I also love math, shockingly, and I consider myself to be a good student.</p>
